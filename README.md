# Two-Way-Chat-Application-Program-Using-Socket-Programming

In this project, we are required to create a chat box using socket programming in python. 
We have to create a webserver through which a minimum of 2 clients can communicate 
with each other. This chat box should be password protected and when the clients 
connect to the server, it will ask for the username and password which upon verification 
will share a list of usernames to the clients from which client will select a name and 
server will match the name/token from both clients. If matched, they both should receive 
a message that “you are allowed to chat now” and messages of the respective clients 
should pass through the server. The chat may end by sending some specific character or 
string.
